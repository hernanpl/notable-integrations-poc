Sonatype's CI/CD integrations—including Bamboo, Jenkins, Maven, GitLab, GitHub, and Azure DevOps—can now retrieve and send Git branch names along with scan data. This enhancement provides better context for security and policy evaluations, ensuring that branch-specific insights are available within reports. By associating scans with their respective branches, developers can more effectively track and address issues. For more details, see the Sonatype CI and CLI Integrations documentation.
